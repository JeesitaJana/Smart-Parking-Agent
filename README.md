# Smart-Parking-Agent
We are building an AI-powered Smart Parking Agent that autonomously manages parking lot operations using computer vision and multi-agent architecture. The agent detects vehicles via edge devices (Raspberry Pi), recognises license plates, assigns optimal spots dynamically, and coordinates barrier control, improving customer experience in real-time.
